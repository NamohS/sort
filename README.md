# Sorting

This C++ program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm. It takes user input to create an array of integers and sorts the array in ascending order using Bubble Sort. The program is a command-line application, making it easy to use for sorting simple lists of numbers.

## Usage
Run the program.
Enter the number of elements and the elements themselves.
The program will sort the array and display the sorted result.
Bubble Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted. This program serves as a simple educational example of Bubble Sort in action.
